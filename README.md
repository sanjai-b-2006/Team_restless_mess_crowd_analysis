Mess Hall Crowd Analysis & Prediction
Project Overview
This project provides a complete data analytics solution to understand, predict, and manage weekly crowd fluctuations in a university mess hall system. The goal is to move from reactive management to a proactive, data-driven strategy by identifying the key factors that influence attendance and building a highly accurate predictive model.
The repository includes:
A detailed Jupyter Notebook with the full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model training process.
A Streamlit web application that serves as an interactive dashboard for predicting future crowd levels.
The trained machine learning model (.joblib file) for immediate use.
A presentation and report summarizing the key findings and recommendations.
